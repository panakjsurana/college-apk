<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="color: #00ffff;">History of Java</span></strong></h3>
<p><strong>Java</strong> is a <a title="General-purpose language" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General-purpose_language">general-purpose</a> <a title="Programming language" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language">programming language</a> that is <a title="Class-based programming" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class-based_programming">class-based</a>, <a title="Object-oriented programming" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">object-oriented</a>, and designed to have as few implementation <a class="mw-redirect" title="Dependency (computer science)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_(computer_science)">dependencies</a> as possible. It is intended to let <a class="mw-redirect" title="Application developer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_developer">application developers</a> <em>write once, run anywhere</em> (WORA),<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup> meaning that <a title="Compiler" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler">compiled</a> Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.<sup id="cite_ref-design_goals_16-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)#cite_note-design_goals-16">[16]</a></sup> Java applications are typically compiled to <a title="Java bytecode" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_bytecode">bytecode</a> that can run on any <a title="Java virtual machine" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine">Java virtual machine</a> (JVM) regardless of the underlying <a title="Computer architecture" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_architecture">computer architecture</a>. The <a title="Syntax (programming languages)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_(programming_languages)">syntax</a> of <a title="Java (software platform)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(software_platform)">Java</a> is similar to <a title="C (programming language)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C</a> and <a title="C++" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B">C++</a>, but it has fewer <a title="Low-level programming language" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-level_programming_language">low-level</a> facilities than either of them. As of 2019, Java was one of the most <a title="Measuring programming language popularity" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measuring_programming_language_popularity">popular programming languages in use</a> according to <a title="GitHub" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub">GitHub</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-:0_17-0" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)#cite_note-:0-17">[17]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)#cite_note-18">[18]</a></sup> particularly for <a class="mw-redirect" title="Client&ndash;server" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server">client-server</a> <a class="mw-redirect" title="Web applications" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_applications">web applications</a>, with a reported 9 million developers.<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)#cite_note-19">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>Java was originally developed by <a title="James Gosling" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Gosling">James Gosling</a> at <a title="Sun Microsystems" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems">Sun Microsystems</a> (<a title="Sun acquisition by Oracle" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_acquisition_by_Oracle">which has since been acquired by Oracle</a>) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' <a title="Java (software platform)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(software_platform)">Java platform</a>. The original and <a title="Reference implementation" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_implementation">reference implementation</a> Java <a title="Compiler" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler">compilers</a>, virtual machines, and <a title="Library (computing)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computing)">class libraries</a> were originally released by Sun under <a class="mw-redirect" title="Proprietary license" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_license">proprietary licenses</a>. As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the <a title="Java Community Process" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Community_Process">Java Community Process</a>, Sun had <a title="Software relicensing" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_relicensing">relicensed</a> most of its Java technologies under the <a title="GNU General Public License" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License">GNU General Public License</a>. Meanwhile, others have developed alternative implementations of these Sun technologies, such as the <a title="GNU Compiler for Java" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_for_Java">GNU Compiler for Java</a> (bytecode compiler), <a title="GNU Classpath" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Classpath">GNU Classpath</a> (standard libraries), and <a title="IcedTea" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IcedTea">IcedTea</a>-Web (browser plugin for applets).</p>
<p>The latest versions are <a title="Java version history" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_version_history">Java&nbsp;13</a>, released in September 2019, and Java&nbsp;11, a currently supported <a title="Long-term support" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_support">long-term support</a> (LTS) version, released on September 25, 2018; <a title="Oracle Corporation" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation">Oracle</a> released for the <a title="Legacy system" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legacy_system">legacy</a> Java&nbsp;8&nbsp;LTS the last free public update in January 2019 for commercial use, while it will otherwise still support Java&nbsp;8 with public updates for personal use up to at least December 2020. Oracle (and others) highly recommend uninstalling older versions of Java because of serious risks due to unresolved security issues.<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)#cite_note-20">[20]</a></sup> Since Java&nbsp;9 (and 10 and 12) is no longer supported, Oracle advises its users to immediately transition to the latest version (currently Java 13) or an LTS release.</p>
